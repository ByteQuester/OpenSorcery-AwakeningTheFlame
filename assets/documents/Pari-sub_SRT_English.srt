1
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,159
No more wine for me.

2
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,039
Neither the murky red.

3
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,040
Nor the bright one.

4
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:09,200
I’m thirsty.

5
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,640
Thirsty for my own blood.

6
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:22,959
Man: Are we getting there?

7
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,680
Woman: Yeah.

8
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,359
Man: Do you see him? He's waving at you.

9
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,800
Man: got all the bags?

10
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,319
Woman: Ah! Sorry...

11
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,840
...yeah, they’re all here.

12
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,960
Man: Bismillah! ("move forward!")

13
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,800
Man: What's he saying?

14
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:49,879
Woman: Asks if we are together...

15
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,560
Man: Say it's my wife.

16
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,399
Man: When did you stored these in the luggage?

17
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,720
Man: So, where is he?

18
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,519
Woman: Maybe he’s outside waiting, we’re late. Want me to go look?

19
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,920
Man: No, you stay right here.

20
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,879
I check.

21
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,199
Man: No praying room around...

22
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,279
Man: Hello?

23
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,759
Babak?

24
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,720
Can you hear me?

25
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,000
Hello?

26
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:35,839
Hello?

27
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:37,079
For God’s sake!

28
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,600
Woman: What happened? Did it cut off?

29
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
Call him again.

30
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,279
Man: I don’t know where this boy is...

31
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,199
Woman: Well, maybe he forgot we’re arriving tonight...

32
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,240
Man: How do you mean, forgot? We’ve been planning this for 3 months now.

33
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,480
Man: Hello?

34
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,480
Hi Farideh.

35
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,959
We are well.

36
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,600
We’re still at the airport.

37
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,519
No worries.

38
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:20,040
Ok.

39
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,399
I’ll call once we get home.

40
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,519
Bye.

41
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,879
Woman: I have his address. Let’s just get a taxi.

42
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,199
Man: What if he’s not home?

43
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,560
Woman: Let’s just go to his home. We find a way.

44
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,879
Man: Wait in the street?

45
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,160
Man: I’m not wandering around a city where we don’t know anyone or the language!

46
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,439
Woman: We can’t stay here waiting till nightfall.

47
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,800
Man: We’ll wait till night if we have to. He said he’d come. He has to come.

48
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,440
Man: Wait, Pari!

49
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,480
Pari!

50
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,519
Pari: Babak?

51
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,759
Man: Wait till they pick up! 

52
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,480
Man: What are they saying?
Pari: They’re speaking Greek.

53
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,960
Man: For God’s sake!

54
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,919
Man: Where have they brought us, a barn?

55
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,919
Don’t go in!

56
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,720
Pari: This is Babak’s handwriting!

57
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,879
Man: What?

58
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,039
Pari: That Babak left here three months ago.

59
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,039
Man: What?

60
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,440
Man: What do they want?

61
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Pari: He owes them money.

62
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:53,279
Man: Apologize to them.

63
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,559
Official: When was the last time you saw your son?

64
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,639
Man: Two years ago.

65
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,639
Official: Has he ever mentioned any trouble with his university?

66
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,240
Man: No, Babak’s an excellent student. He’s here on a scholarship...

67
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,919
...at their best university.

68
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:08,919
University of Athens - Polytechnic.

69
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,000
Official: Yes, we’re aware. His name is on the embassy’s list,

70
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,720
but there seems to be a problem.

71
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:13,639
Man: What kind of problem?

72
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,919
Official: His scholarship has been revoked. It’s been over a year.

73
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,120
Man: Are you sure? He never told us anything.

74
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,600
Official: How come you haven’t seen each other in all this time?

75
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,159
Man: Babak’s been very busy. He didn’t have time to come back to Iran,

76
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,720
and we’re not the kind of family that travels abroad.

77
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,039
Official: If you don’t travel abroad, why send your son here?

78
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,679
Is anyone looking out for him?

79
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,519
Official: Hajji, I understand.

80
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
You’re a respectable family.

81
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,519
But we’ve seen this situation many times here.

82
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,120
Sadly, many of our youth lose their way

83
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,879
because of their freedoms.

84
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,279
so-called freedoms.

85
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,639
Official: Iranian students often drop out and don’t tell their parents,

86
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,960
just so they can keep receiving the scholarship money.

87
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,000
Official: Do you understand what I mean?

88
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Pari: Babak would never do something like that.

89
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,559
Man: Sir, what can we do in this foreign city?

90
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,279
We don’t know anyo...

91
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,559
Official: Mr. Bagheri,

92
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,559
get the university’s address for Hajj Agha.

93
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,679
Bagheri: Right away.

94
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:27,240
Official: At your service.

95
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,919
Man: Why shaking head like that?

96
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,200
Pari: He didn’t enroll this year.

97
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,759
Man: Let’s go.

98
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,679
I told you, let’s go.

99
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,279
Man: What did they say?

100
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,240
Pari: Farrokh, wait!

101
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Just listen for a moment.

102
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,720
Farrokh: I listened to you, and look where it got us.

103
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,720
Pari: You’ve been stressing yourself out for two hours. Calm down, it’s not good for your heart.

104
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,799
Farrokh: I’ll relax when I understand what’s going on.

105
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,480
You knew nothing? 
Pari: No, I swear to God.

106
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,799
Farrokh: Don’t you swear!

107
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,759
He’s been lying to us for three years.

108
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,640
You never had any doubts?

109
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,960
Pari: Have I ever lied to you?

110
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,039
Farrokh: Why do you think he never came back to Iran?

111
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,640
Pari: I told you, he’s a young man... in a new country.

112
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,039
Farrokh: Student life… figuring himself out. You’ve been feeding me the same nonsense for years.

113
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,039
Pari: How is that my fault?

114
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,279
Farrokh: You insisted we send him to this damn place.

115
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,680
Pari: And you agreed to it.

116
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,079
Farrokh: What choice did I have?

117
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:11,079
No one would listen to me.

118
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,680
You filled his head with your fairy tales.

119
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,279
Pari: I only wanted what was best for him.

120
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,839
Farrokh: Well, there you go!

121
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,559
This is your idea of what’s best for him.

122
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:21,079
Are you happy now?

123
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:22,480
Pari: We still don’t know what happened!

124
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,400
Farrokh: What more do you need to happen? He’s left us in this strange city.

125
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,680
Pari: Farrokh, I know Babak. He wouldn’t do this without a reason.

126
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,559
Farrokh: Oh, I know how well you know him.

127
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,240
He brought us here to show us all this mess.

128
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,279
Farrokh: He’s destroyed our honor.

129
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,039
I’ve never been so ashamed in my life.

130
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
Pari: Enough with your honor and pride!

131
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:49,640
Farrokh: Now you’re mocking my honor?

132
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,920
Pari: To hell with your honor! My son is missing!

133
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,319
Farrokh: Last time you talked like this, you ended up in the streets

134
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,920
with a baby in your arms.

135
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,799
Astaghfirullah (seeking "forgiveness")

136
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:19,359
Pari: What do you want from me?

137
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:23,960
Farrokh: What do you want from me?

138
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,000
If honor doesn’t matter to you, why did you stay with me?

139
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,160
I didn’t force you!

140
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:47,799
Farrokh: Let’s go. We need to find a place to stay.

141
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,400
Bagheri: Unfortunately, the police have no trace of him.

142
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Farrokh: How is that even possible?

143
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,240
Bagheri: His student visa expired a year ago. He’s been here illegally. 

144
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,000
Farrokh: He’s been here for years. Can’t they do anything else?

145
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,400
Bagheri: Hajj Agha(Mister), it’s not that simple. He needs to be officially recognized as missing.

146
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,799
Farrokh: Please, see what you can do.

147
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,839
Bagheri: We’ll figure something out.

148
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,799
Farrokh[dreamy voice]: I didn’t force you!

149
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,039
You’ve been with me all these years, but you’ve always dreamed of a different life.

150
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,359
I didn’t force you! (dreamy)

151
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,519
Farrokh: What are you doing?

152
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:46,000
Are you okay, Pari?

153
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,519
Let’s go outside and get some air.

154
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,920
Bagheri: As soon as there’s any news, they’ll inform us. I emphasized that this matter is important to the embassy.

155
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,519
Farrokh: Thank you, sir. What else can we do?

156
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:07,920
Bagheri: Honestly, there’s nothing more we can do. We just have to wait.

157
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,400
Pari: No, sir. We can’t just wait.

158
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,000
Farrokh: Tell me, where do Iranians usually go here? What do they do? Is there a center? A mosque?

159
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,079
Bagheri: There’s the cultural center at the embassy, but your son had no connection with us.

160
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,799
As for the mosque, you might want to check out the church instead.

161
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:27,519
Farrokh: Why a church?

162
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,519
Bagheri: Hajj Agha, things are really bad here.

163
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,680
Farrokh: Speak freely.

164
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,200
Bagheri: Iranians here are in a terrible state. Many convert to Christianity to seek asylum.

165
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,279
Everywhere you go, you see addicted migrants.

166
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,119
Even our women and young men sell themselves for a bit of money

167
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,599
Farrokh: I understand perfectly.

168
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,119
Bagheri: Now, your son may not be caught up in all this, but I had to tell you.

169
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,400
Farrokh: So where do we even start?

170
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,359
Bagheri: Start with this area. It’s where most of the migrants are.

171
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,759
The Iranian shops here have the Zoroastrian symbol.

172
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,240
Many of them are involved in human smuggling.

173
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,039
If you see them, ask around, maybe someone knows your son.

174
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,599
Farrokh: ...Pari, don’t stand by the window... Pari, move away...

175
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,680
Preacher: The story is just beginning.

176
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400
[Clapping]
God knows you’re not perfect.

177
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,599
But you’re the ones who started this journey.

178
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,799
[ Music]
No, unfortunately, I don’t know him.

179
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,799
Farrokh: Sorry for bothering you.

180
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:15,160
Woman: You’re not a bother. This is the house of God, and we are all His children.

181
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:21,359
[Worshiping]

182
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,079
Woman: If there’s anything we can do to help, we’d be happy to.

183
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,799
Farrokh: Nobody knows him.

184
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,839
Pari: Do you remember? He loved the sea.

185
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:46,799
When he was little, he used to say, “I want to be a pirate!”

186
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,519
Farrokh: It’s winter now. We won’t find him at sea.

187
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,160
You’re not eating, not sleeping well, and you’ve even stopped praying.

188
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,319
I’m more worried about you now.

189
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:20,960
We’ve been here a month already. We’re both on edge, and our money’s running out.

190
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,279
Wandering around like this is pointless.

191
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:27,119
Pari: But we’re not looking in the right places.

192
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:30,400
Farrokh: So where should we be looking?

193
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,440
Pari: I feel like Babak was running away from anything that reminded him of Iran.

194
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,039
He didn’t come back to Iran,

195
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,079
and he had no connection with the Iranians here either.

196
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:44,960
He didn’t even write in Persian anymore.

197
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,799
Farrokh: Then where do we search now?

198
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,799
What do you think?

199
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,759
Pari: I don’t know.

200
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,079
Farrokh: I love Babak like my own son.

201
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,400
He carries my name.

202
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,559
I’ll never abandon him.

203
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,359
I’ve asked Bagheri to prepare a request for Interpol.

204
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,839
If they find him anywhere in Europe or the U.S., we’ll be informed.

205
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,640
We’ll wait in Iran, and if they get any news, we’ll come back.

206
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,319
Even if there’s a 1% chance he’s still here,

207
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,559
we can hire a good private investigator.

208
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,759
Pari: Farrokh, I can’t leave here without Babak.

209
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,400
No more wine for me.

210
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:09,680
Neither the murky red.

211
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Nor the bright one.

212
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:18,839
I’m thirsty.

213
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,279
Thirsty for my own blood.

214
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:24,039
spilled in the square.

215
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,559
Farokh: One more.

216
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Farrokh: What are you doing? 

217
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,640
Pari: I found this in Babak’s papers. See? It’s the same symbol as theirs.  

218
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Farrokh: What’s this symbol?  

219
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Pari: They've seen Babak! 

220
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,039
Farrokh: Who are they?  

221
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:41,920
Pari: How should I know? They’re just a group of young people. Farrokh, please. The girl said she saw him around here.  

222
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,279
Farrokh: So she said something, why do you believe her? They’re just a bunch of thugs!  

223
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:50,640
Pari: After all this searching, this is the only clue we’ve found.  

224
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,519
Farrokh: You’ve lost your mind, and now you’re driving me crazy too.

225
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,400
Farrokh: What are you doing? Let’s go!  

226
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,760
Pari: Farrokh, Babak has to be here.  

227
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,079
Farrokh: Enough already!

[Whispering]

229
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,840
No more wine...

230
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:44,599
I’m so thirsty

231
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:46,360
Pari...

232
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,119
Pari...

233
00:49:57,239 --> 00:49:59,480
I was worried sick... where were you?

234
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,679
Pari: I thought it was Babak

235
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:17,920
... Farrokh?

236
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,079
What’s wrong? Are you okay?

237
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:24,480
Farrokh: I feel a little dizzy...

238
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,079
Pari: I couldn’t stop myself, I thought it was him.

239
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,639
I’m sorry.

240
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:35,960
Farrokh: No...

241
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,880
you should forgive me...

242
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,679
I wasn’t the father I should have been.

243
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:43,719
Pari: No, Farrokh, you didn’t fail.

244
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:46,199
Farrokh: I was just doing my duty.

245
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,719
That’s...

246
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:50,719
not enough to be a father.

247
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,400
I knew there was a danger

248
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,639
, but I still let him come here.

249
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:09,000
I wanted to be with you.

250
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,599
I wanted you to be mine.

251
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:19,599
Pari: I am your wife.

252
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:22,679
Farrokh: My wife?

253
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,280
You’re like them.

254
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,920
There’s something inside you.

255
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,920
I’ve seen it with my own eyes

256
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:40,039
, it’s torn so many lives apart.

257
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:47,199
So many good people lost...

258
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,280
I tried to protect you.

259
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,079
But now... the choice is yours.

260
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,719

261
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,599
You’re scaring me.

Come on, let’s go.

00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,920
Tomorrow is another day.

278
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:44,239
Hold on, Farrokh!

279
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,039
Man: Hello, Miss. Pari? Why don't you pick up the phone??  

280
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:51,280
Pari: He died in my arms.  

281
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:54,960
Man: May God rest his soul.  

282
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,840
Pari: It’s all my fault.  

283
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:04,119
Man: No, no, no! Don’t blame yourself. Life and death are in God’s hands. This was meant to be. How are you feeling, Miss. Pari? 

284
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:05,920
Pari: I have to find Babak.  

285
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:09,239
Man: We’ve spoken to the embassy. They’re waiting for your call.  

286
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,119
Pari: I have to find Babak.  

287
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,159
Man: That’s exactly what I’m saying. 

288
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:18,559
I’ve talked to Mr. Bagheri, they’re aware of the situation.  

289
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,559
Pari: They can’t do anything.  

290
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:24,840
Man: Of course they can. Bagheri told me himself, they’re working with Interpol on the report.  

291
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,239
Pari: They’ll never find him. Babak has changed. Only I can find him.  

292
00:57:29,559 --> 00:57:31,440
Man: But how can you find him alone? 

293
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,280
Hello? 

294
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,039
Hello?  

295

Pari: I need to burn.  

296
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:48,719
Man: What do you mean, "burn"? 

297
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:58,000
Pari, you’re in shock. We’re all in shock. 

298
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,239
You need care right now.  

299
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,000
Pari: I need help.  

300
00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:04,519
Man: Whatever you need, we’re here. You can count on me.  

301
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,639
Pari: I need money. I have to stay longer.  

302
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,159
Man: What? 

303
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,039
Stay longer? 

304
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:15,119
What are you saying? A woman alone in a foreign country? Have you lost your mind?

305
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,119
 Please, go to the embassy. They’ll take care of everything. We’ll continue the search. 

306
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:28,880
Hello? Are you listening?  

307
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:34,679
Are you listening?  

308
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,079
Listen, we can’t bring him back without you. His body’s still in the morgue. 

309
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,760
The whole family is waiting here, they want to mourn him.  

310
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,320
 Pari: We will come back together. 

311
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,239
All 3 of us.

312
00:58:57,960 --> 00:58:59,360
I'll find Babak.

313
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:06,320
Man: What’s wrong with you? Has the devil gotten into you? Listen to me! You’re in danger too now. 

314
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:08,039
I'll find Babak.

315
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,639
No more wine for me—

316
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:16,199
Neither the murky red,

317
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:21,880
Nor the crystal-clear white.

318
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:26,880
I thirst for my own blood,

319
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,639
Spilled on the battlefield.

320
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,599
Strike with your sword,

321
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:44,639
Your sharp blade!

322
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,360
Strike!

323
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,559
Strike, until the head spins away from the body.

324
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:56,280
Build a mountain from these fallen heads,

325
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:01,199
Tear me apart!

326
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:09,360
Do not silence me!

327
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:13,360
Do not heed my words!

328
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:18,360
I must walk into the flames!

329
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,800
The fire, my child,

330
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,599
Yet I must burn,

331
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,119
So that I may become the fire.

332
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,000
Strike now, O bringer of chaos,

333
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,000
Break that jug upon the stone,

334
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:19,199
So I no longer draw from the flowing stream,

335
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,960
Nor dip my hands in its waters.

336
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,159
I will forsake the cup-bearer's task,

337
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:37,320
And let myself drown in the ocean.

338
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:35,199
I wanted him to live a way that I couldn't do myself.

339
01:28:36,199 --> 01:28:37,159
I ...

340
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,760
never found the courage myself.

341
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:44,239
I always thought they wouldn’t allow it.

342
01:28:44,359 --> 01:28:47,039
But the truth is, I didn’t dare to.
