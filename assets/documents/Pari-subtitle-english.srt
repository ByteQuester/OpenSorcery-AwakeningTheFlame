1
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:54,160
No more wine for me.

2
00:00:56,944 --> 00:01:00,024
Neither the murky red.

3
00:01:01,008 --> 00:01:05,008
Nor the bright one.

4
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:09,164
I’m thirsty.

5
00:01:09,606 --> 00:01:11,606
Thirsty for my own blood.

6
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:22,944
Man: Are we getting there?

7
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,618
Woman: Yeah.

8
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:33,464
Man: Do you see him? He's waving at you.

9
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:56,788
Man: got all the bags?

10
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,348
Woman: Ah! Sorry...

11
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:04,685
...yeah, they’re all here.

12
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,580
Man: Bismillah! ("move forward!")

13
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:42,184
Man: What's he saying?

14
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,741
Woman: Asks if we are together...

15
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,565
Man: Say it's my wife.

16
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:21,434
Man: When did you stored these in the luggage?

17
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,298
Man: So, where is he?

18
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:02,690
Woman: Maybe he’s outside waiting, we’re late. Want me to go look?

19
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,366
Man: No, you stay right here.

20
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,336
I check.

21
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:39,263
Man: No praying room around...

22
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:49,781
Man: Hello?

23
00:05:49,874 --> 00:05:51,256
Babak?

24
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,545
Can you hear me?

25
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:54,809
Hello?

26
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:56,507
Hello?

27
00:05:57,252 --> 00:05:58,458
For God’s sake!

28
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,458
Woman: What happened? Did it cut off?

29
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,781
Call him again.

30
00:06:06,493 --> 00:06:08,788
Man: I don’t know where this boy is...

31
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:16,583
Woman: Well, maybe he forgot we’re arriving tonight...

32
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:22,544
Man: How do you mean, forgot? We’ve been planning this for 3 months now.

33
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,930
Man: Hello?

34
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:30,369
Hi Farideh.

35
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:33,018
We are well.

36
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:36,944
We’re still at the airport.

37
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:39,945
No worries.

38
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:41,784
Ok.

39
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,975
I’ll call once we get home.

40
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,240
Bye.

41
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:52,241
Woman: I have his address. Let’s just get a taxi.

42
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,090
Man: What if he’s not home?

43
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,090
Woman: Let’s just go to his home. We find a way.

44
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,090
Man: Wait in the street?

45
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:03,109
Man: I’m not wandering around a city where we don’t know anyone or the language!

46
00:07:03,109 --> 00:07:05,663
Woman: We can’t stay here waiting till nightfall.

47
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:10,029
Man: We’ll wait till night if we have to. He said he’d come. He has to come.

48
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:23,924
[music]

49
00:08:14,464 --> 00:08:17,408
Man: Wait, Pari!

50
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:22,224
Pari!

51
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:39,223
Pari: Babak?

52
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:39,722
Man: What are they saying?
Pari: They’re speaking Greek.

53
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:41,722
Man: For God’s sake!

54
00:10:38,646 --> 00:10:42,304
Man: Where have they brought us, a barn?

55
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:44,304
Don’t go in!

56
00:11:05,204 --> 00:11:08,084
Pari: This is Babak’s handwriting!

57
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,624
Man: What?

58
00:11:37,176 --> 00:11:40,787
Pari: That Babak left here three months ago.

59
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,787
Man: What?

60
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:57,269
Man: What do they want?

61
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:59,269
Pari: He owes them money.

62
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,450
Man: Apologize to them.

63
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:09,033
Official: When was the last time you saw your son?

64
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:11,112
Man: Two years ago.

65
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:18,120
Official: Has he ever mentioned any trouble with his university?

66
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,681
Man: No, Babak’s an excellent student. He’s here on a scholarship...

67
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:27,361
...at their best university.

68
00:13:27,361 --> 00:13:29,361
University of Athens - Polytechnic.

69
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:31,463
Official: Yes, we’re aware. His name is on the embassy’s list,

70
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:33,951
but there seems to be a problem.

71
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:34,011
Man: What kind of problem?

72
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:38,395
Official: His scholarship has been revoked. It’s been over a year.

73
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:42,592
Man: Are you sure? He never told us anything.

74
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:47,046
Official: How come you haven’t seen each other in all this time?

75
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:51,618
Man: Babak’s been very busy. He didn’t have time to come back to Iran,

76
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:54,187
and we’re not the kind of family that travels abroad.

77
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:58,483
Official: If you don’t travel abroad, why send your son here?

78
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:02,142
Is anyone looking out for him?

79
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:06,000
Official: Hajji, I understand.

80
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:09,298
You’re a respectable family.

81
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:12,000
But we’ve seen this situation many times here.

82
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:16,590
Sadly, many of our youth lose their way

83
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,321
because of their freedoms.

84
00:14:18,321 --> 00:14:20,734
so-called freedoms.

85
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:26,104
Official: Iranian students often drop out and don’t tell their parents,

86
00:14:26,104 --> 00:14:29,799
just so they can keep receiving the scholarship money.

87
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,821
Official: Do you understand what I mean?

88
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:33,821
Pari: Babak would never do something like that.

89
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,769
Man: Sir, what can we do in this foreign city?

90
00:14:39,975 --> 00:14:40,759
We don’t know anyo...

91
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:42,033
Official: Mr. Bagheri,

92
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:44,033
get the university’s address for Hajj Agha.

93
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:46,622
Bagheri: Right away.

94
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,288
Official: At your service.

95
00:14:52,944 --> 00:14:54,160
No more wine for me.

96
00:14:56,184 --> 00:14:59,120
Neither the murky red.

97
00:14:59,487 --> 00:15:01,487
Nor the bright one.

98
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,459
I’m thirsty.

99
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:10,451
Thirsty for my own blood,

100
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,451
spilled in the square.

101
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,359
Man: Why shaking head like that?

102
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,635
Pari: He didn’t enroll this year.

103
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:08,182
Man: Let’s go.

104
00:15:08,771 --> 00:15:10,108
I told you, let’s go.

105
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,320
Man: What did they say?

106
00:16:45,513 --> 00:16:48,344
Pari: Farrokh, wait!

107
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,779
Just listen for a moment.

108
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,640
Farrokh: I listened to you, and look where it got us.

109
00:17:48,159 --> 00:17:52,960
Pari: You’ve been stressing yourself out for two hours. Calm down, it’s not good for your heart.

110
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,046
Farrokh: I’ll relax when I understand what’s going on.

111
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,781
You knew nothing? 
Pari: No, I swear to God.

112
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:58,097
Farrokh: Don’t you swear!

113
00:17:58,774 --> 00:18:00,872
He’s been lying to us for three years.

114
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,725
You never had any doubts?

115
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,080
Pari: Have I ever lied to you?

116
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,156
Farrokh: Why do you think he never came back to Iran?

117
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:10,746
Pari: I told you, he’s a young man... in a new country.

118
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:15,133
Farrokh: Student life… figuring himself out. You’ve been feeding me the same nonsense for years.

119
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:17,160
Pari: How is that my fault?

120
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,383
Farrokh: You insisted we send him to this damn place.

121
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:20,765
Pari: And you agreed to it.

122
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:22,180
Farrokh: What choice did I have?

123
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
No one would listen to me.

124
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,775
You filled his head with your fairy tales.

125
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:28,363
Pari: I only wanted what was best for him.

126
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,159
Farrokh: Well, there you go!

127
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:32,651
This is your idea of what’s best for him.

128
00:18:33,414 --> 00:18:34,177
Are you happy now?

129
00:18:34,177 --> 00:18:35,565
Pari: We still don’t know what happened!

130
00:18:35,565 --> 00:18:38,518
Farrokh: What more do you need to happen? He’s left us in this strange city.

131
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,784
Pari: Farrokh, I know Babak. He wouldn’t do this without a reason.

132
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:44,680
Farrokh: Oh, I know how well you know him.

133
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,159
He brought us here to show us all this mess.

134
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,178
Farrokh: He’s destroyed our honor.

135
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,499
I’ve never been so ashamed in my life.

136
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:10,499
Pari: Enough with your honor and pride!

137
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,903
Farrokh: Now you’re mocking my honor?

138
00:19:13,176 --> 00:19:16,242
Pari: To hell with your honor! My son is missing!

139
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,744
Farrokh: Last time you talked like this, you ended up in the streets

140
00:19:18,127 --> 00:19:20,327
with a baby in your arms.

141
00:19:24,656 --> 00:19:26,877
Astaghfirullah (seeking "forgiveness")

142
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,480
Pari: What do you want from me?

143
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,252
Farrokh: What do you want from me?

144
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,489
If honor doesn’t matter to you, why did you stay with me?

145
00:19:52,879 --> 00:19:56,496
I didn’t force you!

146
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,737
Farrokh: Let’s go. We need to find a place to stay.

147
00:20:35,664 --> 00:20:39,060
Bagheri: Unfortunately, the police have no trace of him.

148
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,060
Farrokh: How is that even possible?

149
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,915
Bagheri: His student visa expired a year ago. He’s been here illegally. (serious)

150
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:48,674
Farrokh: He’s been here for years. Can’t they do anything else?

151
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:53,529
Bagheri: Hajj Agha, it’s not that simple. He needs to be officially recognized as missing.

152
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:56,007
Farrokh: Please, see what you can do.

153
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:58,068
Bagheri: We’ll figure something out.

154
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:00,154
Farrokh: I didn’t force you!

155
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:03,450
You’ve been with me all these years, but you’ve always dreamed of a different life.

156
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,775
I didn’t force you! (dreamy)

157
00:21:06,777 --> 00:21:09,301
Farrokh: What are you doing?

158
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:11,636
Are you okay, Pari?

159
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,166
Let’s go outside and get some air.

160
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:26,202
Bagheri: As soon as there’s any news, they’ll inform us. I emphasized that this matter is important to the embassy.

161
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,831
Farrokh: Thank you, sir. What else can we do?

162
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:33,295
Bagheri: Honestly, there’s nothing more we can do. We just have to wait.

163
00:21:33,295 --> 00:21:36,795
Pari: No, sir. We can’t just wait.

164
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:43,280
Farrokh: Tell me, where do Iranians usually go here? What do they do? Is there a center? A mosque?

165
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,359
Official: There’s the cultural center at the embassy, but your son had no connection with us.

166
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,151
As for the mosque, you might want to check out the church instead.

167
00:21:51,151 --> 00:21:52,857
Farrokh: Why a church?

168
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:54,857
Official: Hajj Agha, things are really bad here.

169
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:56,642
Farrokh: Speak freely.

170
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:02,188
Official: Iranians here are in a terrible state. Many convert to Christianity to seek asylum.

171
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:04,600
Everywhere you go, you see addicted migrants.

172
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,425
Even our women and young men sell themselves for a bit of money

173
00:22:08,425 --> 00:22:10,044
Farrokh: I understand perfectly.

174
00:22:10,044 --> 00:22:14,589

Bagheri: Start with this area. It’s where most of the migrants are.

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,634
Pari: Do you remember? He loved the sea.

191
00:29:08,634 --> 00:29:11,577
When he was little, he used to say, “I want to be a pirate!”

192
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:18,289
Farrokh: It’s winter now. We won’t find him at sea.

You’re not eating, not sleeping well, and you’ve even stopped praying.

I’m more worried about you now.

We’ve been here a month already. We’re both on edge, and our money’s running out.

Wandering around like this is pointless.

Pari: But we’re not looking in the right places.

198
00:29:53,148 --> 00:29:55,161
Farrokh: So where should we be looking?

199
00:29:57,015 --> 00:30:02,213
Pari: I feel like Babak was running away from anything that reminded him of Iran.

200
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:03,802
He didn’t come back to Iran,

201
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,863
and he had no connection with the Iranians here either.

202

He didn’t even write in Persian anymore.

He carries my name.

208
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,357
I’ll never abandon him.

209
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:44,125
I’ve asked Bagheri to prepare a request for Interpol.

210
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,640
If they find him anywhere in Europe or the U.S., we’ll be informed.

211
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,436
We’ll wait in Iran, and if they get any news, we’ll come back.

212

Even if there’s a 1% chance he’s still here,

213
00:30:54,665 --> 00:30:56,329
we can hire a good private investigator.

I’m thirsty.

Thirsty for my own blood,

221
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,517
spilled in the square.

Pari: Farrokh, wait!

228
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,779
Just listen for a moment.

229
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,640
Farrokh: I listened to you, and look where it got us.

230
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:31,960
Pari: You’ve been stressing yourself out for two hours. Calm down, it’s not good for your heart.

231
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,046
Farrokh: I’ll relax when I understand what’s going on.

232
00:32:34,046 --> 00:32:35,781
You knew nothing? 
Pari: No, I swear to God.

233
00:32:35,781 --> 00:32:37,097
Farrokh: Don’t you swear!

234
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:39,872
He’s been lying to us for three years.

235
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:41,725
You never had any doubts?

236
00:32:41,725 --> 00:32:43,080
Pari: Have I ever lied to you?

237
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,156
Farrokh: Why do you think he never came back to Iran?

238
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:49,746
Pari: I told you, he’s a young man... in a new country.

239
00:32:49,746 --> 00:32:54,133
Farrokh: Student life… figuring himself out. You’ve been feeding me the same nonsense for years.

240
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:56,160
Pari: How is that my fault?

241
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,383
Farrokh: You insisted we send him to this damn place.

242
00:32:58,383 --> 00:32:59,765
Pari: And you agreed to it.

243
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:01,180
Farrokh: What choice did I have?

244
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,180
No one would listen to me.

245
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:05,775
You filled his head with your fairy tales.

246
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,363
Pari: I only wanted what was best for him.

247
00:33:07,363 --> 00:33:08,159
Farrokh: Well, there you go!

248
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:11,651
This is your idea of what’s best for him.

249
00:33:12,414 --> 00:33:13,177
Are you happy now?

250
00:33:13,177 --> 00:33:14,565
Pari: We still don’t know what happened!

251
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:17,518
Farrokh: What more do you need to happen? He’s left us in this strange city.

252
00:33:17,518 --> 00:33:20,784
Pari: Farrokh, I know Babak. He wouldn’t do this without a reason.

253
00:33:20,784 --> 00:33:23,680
Farrokh: Oh, I know how well you know him.

254
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,159
He brought us here to show us all this mess.

255
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,178
Farrokh: He’s destroyed our honor.

256
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,499
I’ve never been so ashamed in my life.

257
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:50,499
Pari: Enough with your honor and pride!

258
00:33:51,083 --> 00:33:52,903
Farrokh: Now you’re mocking my honor?

259
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:56,242
Pari: To hell with your honor! My son is missing!

260
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,744
Farrokh: Last time you talked like this, you ended up in the streets

261
00:33:58,127 --> 00:34:00,327
with a baby in your arms.

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,252
Farrokh: What do you want from me?

265
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:32,489
If honor doesn’t matter to you, why did you stay with me?

266
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,496
I didn’t force you!

267
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,737
Farrokh: Let’s go. We need to find a place to stay.

268
00:35:35,664 --> 00:35:39,060
Bagheri: Unfortunately, the police have no trace of him.

269
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,060
Farrokh: How is that even possible?

270
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,915
Bagheri: His student visa expired a year ago. He’s been here illegally. (serious)

271
00:35:44,915 --> 00:35:48,674
Farrokh: He’s been here for years. Can’t they do anything else?

272
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:53,529
Bagheri: Hajj Agha, it’s not that simple. He needs to be officially recognized as missing.

273
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:56,007
Farrokh: Please, see what you can do.

274
00:35:56,007 --> 00:35:58,068
Bagheri: We’ll figure something out.

275
00:35:58,274 --> 00:36:00,154
Farrokh: I didn’t force you!

276
00:36:00,154 --> 00:36:03,450
You’ve been with me all these years, but you’ve always dreamed of a different life.

277
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,775
I didn’t force you! (dreamy)

278
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:09,301
Farrokh: What are you doing?

279
00:36:10,714 --> 00:36:11,636
Are you okay, Pari?

280
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,166
Let’s go outside and get some air.

281
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:26,202
Bagheri: As soon as there’s any news, they’ll inform us. I emphasized that this matter is important to the embassy.

282
00:36:26,202 --> 00:36:29,831
Farrokh: Thank you, sir. What else can we do?

283
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:33,295
Bagheri: Honestly, there’s nothing more we can do. We just have to wait.

284
00:36:33,295 --> 00:36:36,795
Pari: No, sir. We can’t just wait.

285
00:36:37,472 --> 00:36:43,280
Farrokh: Tell me, where do Iranians usually go here? What do they do? Is there a center? A mosque?

286
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,359
Official: There’s the cultural center at the embassy, but your son had no connection with us.

287
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:51,151
As for the mosque, you might want to check out the church instead.

288
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:52,857
Farrokh: Why a church?

289
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:54,857
Official: Hajj Agha, things are really bad here.

290
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:56,642
Farrokh: Speak freely.

291
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:02,188
Official: Iranians here are in a terrible state. Many convert to Christianity to seek asylum.

292
00:37:02,188 --> 00:37:04,600
Everywhere you go, you see addicted migrants.

293
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,425
Even our women and young men sell themselves for a bit of money

294
00:37:08,425 --> 00:37:10,044

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,515
I’m thirsty.

341
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:47,517
Thirsty for my own blood,

342
00:46:47,517 --> 00:46:49,517
spilled in the square.

343
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:44,332
[Whispering]

344
00:49:44,509 --> 00:49:46,509
No more wine...

345
00:49:47,451 --> 00:49:49,451
I’m so thirsty

346
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:52,957
Pari...

347
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:54,357
Pari...

348
00:50:03,419 --> 00:50:05,653
I was worried sick... where were you?

349
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,284
Pari: I thought it was Babak

350
00:50:23,843 --> 00:50:24,547
... Farrokh?

351
00:50:25,626 --> 00:50:26,705
What’s wrong? Are you okay?

352
00:50:28,824 --> 00:50:31,093
Farrokh: I feel a little dizzy...

353
00:50:35,584 --> 00:50:38,544
Pari: I couldn’t stop myself, I thought it was him.

354
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:41,104
I’m sorry.

355
00:50:41,764 --> 00:50:42,424
Farrokh: No...

356
00:50:43,278 --> 00:50:44,333
you should forgive me...

357
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:48,142
I wasn’t the father I should have been.

358
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:50,173
Pari: No, Farrokh, you didn’t fail.

359
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,669
Farrokh: I was just doing my duty.

360
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:55,179
That’s...

361
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:57,179
not enough to be a father.

362
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:03,858
I knew there was a danger

363
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,961
, but I still let him come here.

364
00:51:13,258 --> 00:51:15,337
I wanted to be with you.

365
00:51:18,457 --> 00:51:20,944
I wanted you to be mine.

366
00:51:24,062 --> 00:51:25,944
Pari: I am your wife.

367
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,011
Farrokh: My wife?

368
00:51:32,205 --> 00:51:33,604
You’re like them.

369
00:51:35,841 --> 00:51:38,276
There’s something inside you.

370
00:51:40,762 --> 00:51:43,248
I’ve seen it with my own eyes

371
00:51:43,748 --> 00:51:46,397
, it’s torn so many lives apart.

372
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:53,537
So many good people lost...

373
00:51:55,068 --> 00:51:57,609
I tried to protect you.

374
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:02,419
But now... the choice is yours.

375
00:52:03,714 --> 00:52:06,073
Pari: Why are you talking like this, Farrokh?

376
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,944
You’re scaring me.

377
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,336
Farrokh: I don’t know.

378
00:52:17,556 --> 00:52:19,479
My mind’s all over the place.

379
00:52:25,013 --> 00:52:26,489
Come on, let’s go.

380
00:52:28,225 --> 00:52:30,225
Tomorrow is another day.

381
00:53:09,224 --> 00:53:11,852
Farrokh: Pari, make me some tea with candy.

382
00:53:12,029 --> 00:53:13,147
Pari: Did you take your pill?

383
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:17,012
Farrokh: Yeah, but my stomach’s a bit upset.

384
00:53:55,724 --> 00:53:56,705
Pari: Farrokh?

385
00:54:00,472 --> 00:54:02,472
Farrokh? get up, it’s ready...

386
00:54:02,443 --> 00:54:03,276
Farrokh?

387
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:06,646
Farrokh?

388
00:54:09,236 --> 00:54:10,266
Farrokh?

389
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:15,505
Farrokh?

390
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:18,005
Farrokh?

391
00:54:19,122 --> 00:54:20,239
Help!

392
00:54:44,078 --> 00:54:46,190
Farrokh? Can you hear me?

393
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:50,731
Hold on, Farrokh!

394
01:00:30,944 --> 01:00:33,283
[Whispering]

395
01:00:33,283 --> 01:00:35,283
No more wine for me—

396
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:38,119
Neither the murky red,

397
01:00:38,175 --> 01:00:40,301
Nor the crystal-clear white.

398
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,242
I thirst for my own blood,

399
01:00:43,242 --> 01:00:46,946
Spilled on the battlefield.

400
01:00:52,827 --> 01:00:55,802
Strike with your sword,

401
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,819
Your sharp blade!

402
01:00:59,086 --> 01:01:00,486
Strike!

403
01:01:01,235 --> 01:01:06,384
Strike, until the head spins away from the body.

404
01:01:07,884 --> 01:01:10,029
Build a mountain from these fallen heads,

405
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:13,775
Tear me apart!

406
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:21,971
Do not silence me!

407
01:01:24,325 --> 01:01:26,325
Do not heed my words!

408
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:29,908
I must walk into the flames!

409
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,820
The fire, my child,

410
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:36,759
Yet I must burn,

411
01:01:38,634 --> 01:01:40,747
So that I may become the fire.

412
01:45:04,716 --> 01:45:07,830
Strike now, O bringer of chaos,

413
01:45:10,188 --> 01:45:13,840
Break that jug upon the stone,

414
01:45:20,162 --> 01:45:23,931
So I no longer draw from the flowing stream,

415
01:45:25,164 --> 01:45:28,164
Nor dip my hands in its waters.

416
01:45:30,565 --> 01:45:33,308
I will forsake the cup-bearer's task,

417
01:45:37,166 --> 01:45:40,349
And let myself drown in the ocean.

418
01:28:41,026 --> 01:28:45,208
I wanted him to live a way that I couldn't do myself.

419
01:28:46,201 --> 01:28:47,194
I ...

420
01:28:47,954 --> 01:28:50,772
never found the courage myself.

421
01:28:51,365 --> 01:28:54,404
I always thought they wouldn’t allow it.

422
01:28:54,669 --> 01:28:57,350
But the truth is, I didn’t dare to.
